    <p>The front end is a combination of two different elements: the graphic design (the look) and the user interface (the feel). Each of these is created independently, with most of the technical work going into the user interface using web languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
<P>The back end refers to parts of a computer application or a program's code that allow it to operate and that cannot be accessed by a user. Most data and operating syntax are stored and accessed in the back end of a computer system. Typically the code is comprised of one or more programming languages.</P>
